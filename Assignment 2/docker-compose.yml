# addition nodes can be added under services.
# Make sure that all nodes have a port that on the host device that is unique.
# For example node0 has port 9090, node1 has 9091. Additional nodes can be numbered in the same way.
# Make sure the name of the node and the (host) port number correspond to the ones listed in addresses_docker.txt
